        Mercury is a small planet which orbits closer to the sun than
        any other planet in our solar system.
        
        • Mercury has no moons.
        
        • Mercury’s surface is very hot, it features a barren, crater
        covered surface which looks similar to Earth’s moon.
        
        • Mercury is so close to the Sun, the daytime temperature is scorching
        reaching over 400 degrees Celsius.
        
        • At night however, without an atmosphere to hold heat in, the
        temperatures plummet, dropping to -180 degrees Celsius.
        
        • Mercury has a very low surface gravity.
        
        • Mercury has no atmosphere which means there is no wind or
        weather to speak of.
        
        • Mercury has no water or air on the surface.`,

    description: `
        Venus is named after the Roman goddess of
        love and beauty.
        • Venus is the second planet from the sun.
        • Is the brightest object in the sky besides our
        Sun and the Moon.
        Venus’ symbol
        • Has no moons.
        • It is also known as the morning star because at sunrise it appears
        in the east. It is also known as evening star as it appears at sunset
        when it is in the west. It cannot be seen in the middle of the night.
        • Venus and Earth are close together in space and similar in size,
        which is the reason Venus is called Earth's sister planet.
        • Venus has more volcanoes than any other planet.
        • It is the hottest planet in the solar system, even hotter than
        Mercury, which is closer to the Sun.
        • The temperature on the surface of Venus is about 460° Celsius.
        • The atmosphere on Venus is composed of carbon dioxide. The
        surface is heated by radiation from the sun, but the heat cannot
        escape through the clouds and layer of carbon dioxide. (This is a
        “greenhouse effect”).`,

    description: `
        • All of the planets, except for Earth, were
        named after Greek and Roman gods and
        goddesses. The name Earth is an Old English and
        German name which simply means soil.
        •Earth is the third planet from the sun.
        • Has one moon.
        • It is the only planet that has liquid water on its surface.
        • It is the only planet in the solar system that has life.
        • The Earth is fragile. Its surface is split into plates (tectonic plates)
        which float on a rocky mantle – the layer between the surface of
        the earth, its crust, and its hot liquid core. The inside of the Earth
        is active and earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain building
        takes place along the boundaries of the tectonic plates.
        • The Earth is larger than Mercury, Venus and Mars, the planets
        closest to it.
        • The Earth differs from all the other planets because it has such a
        wide diversity of life and intelligent beings. This has only been
        possible because of the Earth’s atmosphere which has protected
        the Earth and allowed life to flourish`,

  mars: {

    rotation: 24.6,
    day: 24.7,
    distance: 227.9,
    moons: 2,
    gravity: 3.7,
    description: `
        • Mars was named after the Roman god of war,
        it is also described as the “Red Planet” because it
        is covered with rust-like dust.
        •Mars is the fourth planet from the sun.
        •It is the second smallest planet in the Solar System.
        • Has two moons.
        • Mars looks a lot like our home, though instead of blue oceans
        and green land, Mars is home to an ever present red tint. This is
        due to a mineral called iron oxide that is very common on the
        planet’s surface.
        • Mars has many massive volcanoes and is home to Olympus
        Mons, the largest volcano in our solar system, it stands 21km high
        and is 600km across the base.
        • Mars has seasons like Earth too. These seasons are much longer
        than Earth seasons because Mars is so much farther from the sun.
        • Mars experiences violent dust storms which continually change its
        surface.
        • Mars has a very thin atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide.
        It is not thick enough to trap the sun's heat like Venus, so the
        planet is very cold. Temperatures range from -120 Degrees
        Celsius on winter nights to 25 Degrees Celsius in the
        summer.`,

    description: `
        •It is called after the ancient Roman sky-god,
        Jupiter, known to the Greeks as Zeus.

        •Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun.
        
        •Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar system. It is
        so big that more than 1300 Earths could fit inside it.
        Jupiter’s symbol
        
        • Has 63 moons! The first 4 largest moons of Jupiter are called Galilean
        moons but 46 of them are much smaller ranging.
        
        • Jupiter is the stormiest planet in the Solar System. There is a permanent,
        but ever-changing whirlpool of storms, known as Jupiter’s Great Red
        Spot which can be seen using a telescope.
        
        • The Red Spot was first seen by Robert Hooke in 1664.
        
        • Jupiter is the first of the “gas giants”, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
        Neptune.
        
        • Jupiter is made of hydrogen, helium, methane and ammonia. The
        cloudy sphere has bright belts on it which change their shape.
        
        • If you were to descend into Jupiter, the thin, cold atmosphere
        becomes thicker and hotter, gradually turning into a thick, dark fog. In
        the blackness about 1000km down the pressure squeezes the
        atmosphere so hard that it becomes like liquid.`,

  saturn: {

    description: `
        • Saturn was named after the ancient Roman
        god of agriculture.
        • Is the sixth planet from the sun.
        • Saturn is the second largest planet in our Solar
        System, after the giant Jupiter.
        • Has 62 moons!
        • Saturn is the last planet that can be seen without using a telescope or
        binoculars and the planet was known in the ancient world before
        telescopes were invented. The rings, however, can only be seen using
        a telescope.
        • The rings were first seen by Galileo in 1610 through a telescope.
        • The rings are made up of millions of ice crystals, some as big as houses
        and others as small as specks of dust.
        • The four largest outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, are
        known as the “gas giants” since it is thought they are entirely made up
        of dense layers of gas. Saturn is a great ball of hydrogen and helium.
        • Saturn is very light as it is made up of more hydrogen that helium so it is
        less dense.
        • Saturn is not a peaceful planet. Storm winds race around the
        atmosphere at 800kmp/h.`,

    description: `
        •Uranus was named after the Greek god of the
        sky.
        •Is the seventh planet from the sun.
        •Uranus was the first planet discovered by
        telescope.
        • Has 27 moons.
        • Uranus was first seen by William Herschel in 1781 during a survey of the
        sky using a telescope.
        • Rolls like a barrel rather than spinning like Earth and the other planets in
        our Solar System.
        • Uranus is the coldest planet in our Solar System.
        • Uranus is one of the “gas giants”, the four outer planets which are
        entirely composed of gas, Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune.
        • Uranus is the smallest of the four “giants”, but is still several times larger
        than the Earth.
        • Uranus’s atmosphere is mostly hydrogen but it also contains large
        amounts of a gas called methane. Methane absorbs red light and
        scatters blue light so a blue-green methane haze hides the interior of
        the planet from view.`,

        •Neptune is named after the Roman god of the
sea.
•Is the eighth planet in the Solar System.
•Is the farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar
System.
• Has 13 moons.
• Neptune is one of the four “gas giants”. Like Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus,
it is composed only of gas. Neptune is a great ball of hydrogen and
helium.
• In the same year that Neptune was first seen, 1846, its first moon was
also spotted and named Triton. Triton is a most unusual moon since it
orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of Neptune’s own rotation on
its axis. All the other major satellites (moons) in the Solar System follow
their planets round as they turn.
• Neptune is a large, water planet with a blue hydrogen-methane
atmosphere and faint rings.
• Neptune suffers the most violent weather in our Solar System.
• Storms have been spotted swirling around its surface and freezing
winds that blow about ten times faster than hurricanes on Earth making
it the windiest planet in the Solar System.`,
